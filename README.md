# Github Connector

**WIP**

Discord bot to resolve links to GitHub issues (and PRs). Since Discord does not allow bots to edit messages for other users, this bot simply waits for messages containing `#1`, `some-repo#1` or `org/repo#1` and then answers with a link to the issue. A default org/user and repo can be configured to resolve incomplete links like `#1`.
